# Project Status

Status: Accepted project control document  
Owner: Project maintainer  
Last verified: 2026-07-13

This page is the operational front door. It reports verified progress; it does not replace product contracts, architecture, tasks, or release evidence.

## Current position

| Item | State |
| --- | --- |
| Target | Release L3: single-node self-hosted production |
| Current maturity | L1 capabilities exist, but the L1 evidence set is incomplete |
| Active delivery phase | Phase 1: production foundation |
| Active task | None; `DAT-002` implementation and local evidence complete |
| Next task candidate | `DAT-003` production database profile and repository adapters |
| Production readiness | Not ready |

## Verified strengths

- Local FastAPI and React/Vite workspace with import, indexing, exploration, search, evidence, graph, impact, and assistant surfaces.
- Safe archive controls, multi-language parsing, deep Python analysis foundations, deterministic retrieval, evidence IDs, stale evidence, incremental indexing, and grounded fallback.
- Accepted target architecture, domain contracts, production foundation ADR, and a dependency-aware task register.
- Accepted implementation-ready PostgreSQL schema/ERD covering 35 production tables, composite ownership, lifecycle constraints, access indexes, and migration order.
- Alembic production baseline, PostgreSQL 18.4 integration profile, zero-drift gate, and supported nine-table SQLite upgrade mapper verified by `DAT-002`.

## Blocking gaps

1. The application runtime still uses SQLite; production repository/session adapters have not switched to PostgreSQL.
2. Index jobs are process-local rather than durable and recoverable.
3. Index artifacts are not yet published through a validated immutable version boundary.
4. Parser/code-analysis responsibilities overlap and equivalence is not proven.
5. Retrieval, citation, graph, incremental, security, performance, and resilience gates lack complete release evidence.
6. Frontend navigation, server state, error states, accessibility, and E2E coverage are incomplete.
7. Authentication, observability, backup/restore, deployment, and runbooks are not production complete.

The detailed and source-verified account is maintained in `14-implementation-baseline/`. Do not update this page from assumptions.

## Immediate sequence

1. Publish and review the `DAT-002` migration evidence and CI result.
2. Authorize `DAT-003` before changing the application database/session/repository runtime.
3. Keep durable worker behavior and artifact publication in their owning later tasks.

## Status update rule

Change this document only when the linked baseline or evidence changes. A task count, merged branch, or working demo does not by itself advance a release level.
